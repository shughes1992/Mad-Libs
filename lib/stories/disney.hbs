Last month, I went to Disney World with {{name}}. We traveled for hours by {{vehicle}}. Finally, we got there and it was very {{adjective}}. There were {{adjective}} people {{verb}} everywhere. There were also people dressed up in {{animal}} costumes. I wish it had been more {{adjective}}, but we {{verb}} anyway. We also went on {{number}} {{adjective}} rides, but my favorite was called "Magic {{noun}}". {{name}} nearly fell off a ride and had to be {{verb}}. Later we went to the hotel and {{verb}}. Next year, I want to go to {{place}}, where we can {{verb}}.
